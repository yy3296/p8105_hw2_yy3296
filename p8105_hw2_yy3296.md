### Problem 1

Below we import and clean data from
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. The process begins with
data import, updates variable names, and selects the columns that will
be used in later parts fo this problem. We update `entry` from `yes` /
`no` to a logical variable. As part of data import, we specify that
`Route` columns 8-11 should be character for consistency with 1-7.

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

As it stands, these data are not “tidy”: route number should be a
variable, as should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would
need to convert `route` variables from wide to long format. This will be
useful when focusing on specific routes, but may not be necessary when
considering questions that focus on station-level variables.

The following code chunk selects station name and line, and then uses
`distinct()` to obtain all unique combinations. As a result, the number
of rows in this dataset is the number of unique stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
    ##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
    ## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
    ## # … with 455 more rows

The next code chunk is similar, but filters according to ADA compliance
as an initial step. This produces a dataframe in which the number of
rows is the number of ADA compliant stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    station_name                   line           
    ##    <chr>                          <chr>          
    ##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
    ##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
    ##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
    ##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
    ##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
    ##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
    ##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
    ##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # … with 74 more rows

To compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance, we first exclude station entrances that do not allow
vending. Then, we focus on the `entry` variable – this logical, so
taking the mean will produce the desired proportion (recall that R will
coerce logical to numeric in cases like this).

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

Lastly, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A
train, and to assess how many of these are ADA compliant. As a first
step, we tidy the data as alluded to previously; that is, we convert
`route` from wide to long format. After this step, we can use tools from
previous parts of the question (filtering to focus on the A train, and
on ADA compliance; selecting and using `distinct` to obtain dataframes
with the required stations in rows).

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 × 2
    ##    station_name                  line           
    ##    <chr>                         <chr>          
    ##  1 Times Square                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  2 125th St                      8 Avenue

    ##  5 168th St - Washington Heights 8 Avenue

### Problem 2

I clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet including specifing the sheet in the
Excel file and to omit non-data entries, omitting rows that do not
include dumpster-specific data, and rounding the number of sports balls
to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer
variable.Then, I add a new variable “TrashWheel”, and named
“MrTrashWheel” which can represent Mr. Trash Wheel dataset in combined
dataset.

``` r
clean_MrTrashWheel = 
  read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx", range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)),
         TrashWheel = "MrTrashWheel")
```

I clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet including specifing the sheet in
the Excel file and to omit non-data entries, omitting rows that do not
include dumpster-specific data, and transferring the year variable into
character.Then, I add a new variable “TrashWheel”, and named
“ProTrashWheel” which can represent Professor Trash Wheel dataset in
combined dataset.

``` r
clean_ProTrashWheel = 
  read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(TrashWheel = "ProTrashWheel",
         year = as.character(year))
```

I combine tidy Mr. Trash Wheel dataset with tidy Professor Trash Wheel
dataset.

``` r
combine_Mr_Pro = bind_rows(clean_MrTrashWheel, clean_ProTrashWheel)
```

-   There are 641 observations, 15 variables which are dumpster, month,
    year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
    polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags,
    chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered, TrashWheel.
-   The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is
    190.12
-   The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
    2020 is 856.

### Problem 3

I clean the data in pols-month.csv and break up the variable mon into
integer variables year, month, and day. Then, I replace month number
with month name. In addition, I create a president variable taking
values gop and dem, and I remove prez_dem, prez_gop, and the day
variable by using select function.

``` r
clean_pols_month = 
  read.csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, "01" = "January", "02" = "February", "03" = "March", "04" = "April", "05" = "May", "06" = "June", "07" = "July", "08" = "August", "09" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December"), 
         president = prez_gop,
         president = as.character(president),
         president = recode(president, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop")) %>%
  select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop)
```

I clean the data in snp.csv and break up the variable date into integer
variables month, day, and year. Then, I change the format of year from 2
digits to 4 digits, like from 15 to 2015; and I change the month
variable to integer. Then, I arrange all data according to year and
month, and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.
Besides, I replace month number with month name.

``` r
clean_snp = 
  read.csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year) + 2000, year = ifelse(year >= 2050, year-100, year), month = as.integer(month)) %>%
  select(year, month, everything()) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "January", "2" = "February", "3" = "March", "4" = "April", "5" = "May", "6" = "June", "7" = "July", "8" = "August", "9" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December")) 
```

I clean the unemployment data to prepare for merging with the previous
datasets. I switch this dataset from “wide” to “long” format and change
the name of month from abbreviation to full name to ensuring that key
variables have the same name. and ensuring that key variables take the
same values. Then, I change the year to the character to ensure that key
variables take the same values.

``` r
clean_unemployment = 
  read.csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "percentage of unemployment in month of the associated year") %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, "Jan" = "January", "Feb" = "February", "Mar" = "March", "Apr" = "April", "May" = "May", "Jun" = "June", "Jul" = "July", "Aug" = "August", "Sep" = "September", "Oct" = "October", "Nov" = "November", "Dec" = "December")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```
